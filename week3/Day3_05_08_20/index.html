            <p>There's more visuval freedom in parallax website design.Rather than focusing on block style information
                architecture,you can create refreshing and engaging such as animations or beautiful photography that act
                as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to scroll for the down page. </p>

            <p>Do you want to tell a story with our product or service? Longs-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative

            <p>Mobiles and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It's now less about clicking and more
                about scrolling,swiping and tapping. Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex
                navigation, providing a responsive, user friendly experience for mobile users</p>

            <p>parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor website browsers, as it forces businesses to
                convey their message and vision into one dynamec web design page</p>

            <p>These days scrolling is so simple that it's become an instinctive action, whereas clicking through to
                another page requires thought and motivation. A single page website allows user to identify their
                purpose on the website quicker, than needing to sift through multiple pages.</p>

            <h2>YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY</h2>
            <P>One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that they are not SEO friendly. Why? when you
                limit the number of pages on your website, Google has Fewer pages to index and negatively impacts your
                standing on the search engine results page(SERP).Luckily there are ways around this.</P>

            <img src="/images/image10.jpg" width="900px" height="250px">
            <p>50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the more high resolution
                imegery and animations you include, the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this article, we
                tested some popular parallax websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30seconds
                to load on mobile device, where as simple and minimallist long-scroll websites loaded with in a few
                seconds </p>

            <p>Instead of hitting the "back" button, users must scroll back up the page which can be frustrating for
                users who want to refer back to a certain elements. An easy way around this is to include top navigation
                and have each element ancored to a category or section.</p>
